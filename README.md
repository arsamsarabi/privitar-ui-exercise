## Running the app locally

- Copy `.env.example` file in the root folder of the application and rename it to `.env`
- Assign correct values to the environment variables `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_API_KEY`

## Built with

1. `create-react-app --template typescript` as per the instructions
2. `MobX` => state management
3. `styled-components` => styling
4. `framer-motion` => animations
   - (a little bit of an overkill for this project!)

## Unit Tests

Not a lot of time was spent on writting tests, only a few examples are implemented.
